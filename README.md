The aim of this project was to create an application that would automate and improve the transaction processes of the BitMEX exchange, and thus 
extend the functionality of this exchange. The assumed goal was achieved through the implementation of automatic order placement systems and receiving
notifications in the event of changes in the cryptocurrency price.

- The mechanisms presented in the project allow for setting orders in an intuitive way, which will then be put on the exchange when certain conditions are met.
- Taking into account the dynamics of online exchanges, the application has been equipped with a continuous connection with information on the Bitcoin price, which 
allows for accurate order setting as well as price notifications, making people using this platform able to react faster to very dynamically changing conditions
of Internet exchanges, so they can get better results. 
- As the application uses very sensitive customer data, which are the BitMEX access keys, it has also been secured with Google two-factor authentication.
- The program controls errors returned by the exchange as well as unusual user actions, which, if not handled, would result in blocking the application. The user of this website can be anyone who only has an account on the BitMEX exchange.

Main landing page look as follows:

A step forward would be to implement specific cryptocurrency playing tactics, so that the user would not have to engage in any game on the stock market, 
but would set the tactics and the program would play for him.
- Many people do not use only one cryptocurrency exchange, so a very good idea to increase interest in the application would be the ability to add accounts from many online exchanges. The addition of graphic representations of previously issued user orders 
could also help. By seeing the stories of his stock market actions, he could better analyze where the mistakes were made. 
- Another functionality facilitating being up-to-date with the situation on the stock exchange would be the ability to receive notifications directly via text messages on the user's phone.

The application in its current state implements the aspect of managing the BitMEX cryptocurrency exchange through solutions extending and facilitating the use of
functions already available on the exchange, which makes it possible to achieve the goal of the project, which is an intuitive and effective extension of the 
current functionality of the exchange.
